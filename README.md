# jiprolog
JIProlog - Java Internet Prolog is a cross-platform pure Java 100% Prolog interpreter which integrates Prolog and Java languages in a very easy way. JIProlog allows to call Prolog predicates from Java without dealing with native code (JNI) and it allows to invoke Java methods from Prolog in the same way you call predicates.
